# Ubuntu-Fixer
This repository has a variety of bash scripts that will "fix" Ubuntu, removing all traces of Snap and the Snap Store, and replacing it with Flatpak and Gnome Software (or KDE Discover).
It is still a work in progress, as currently, I only have an Ubuntu script, and none for any of the flavors, however, those should'nt bee too hard to add because they will be very similar to (and possibly the same as), the Ubuntu script.
The goal of this script is to avoid throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Ubuntu has quite a few good aspects. It is a more complete version of debian, coming with necessary user tools, it has well maintained repositories based on the debian testing repos, and, unlike other distros, it actually integrates well with desktop environments like lxqt, xfce, and mate. The only real Downside to Ubuntu is snaps.
